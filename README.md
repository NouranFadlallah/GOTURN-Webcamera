# GOTURN-Webcamera
A web camera based implementation of GOTURN object tracking algorithm using opencv.

GOTURN paper is published as [Learning to Track at 100 FPS with Deep Regression Networks](http://davheld.github.io/GOTURN/GOTURN.html), European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV), 2016

GOTURN is used for fast single target tracking given a bounding box in the first frame. For this implemenatation [opencv tracker](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d2/d0a/tutorial_introduction_to_tracker.html) is used.
